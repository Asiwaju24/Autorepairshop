Autorepairshop

Autorepairshop is a web application designed to support basic workflow and interface needs for a car repair or automobile service shop. It serves as a frontend structure that can be expanded into a full workshop management system, providing an organized way to present services, manage interactions, and prepare for more advanced features such as job tracking, customer records, and repair scheduling.

This project also functions as a practical template for experimenting with JavaScript-based interfaces, Tailwind CSS styling, and modern deployment setups.

Project Overview

The application provides the foundational UI for an auto repair shop, including layout, styles, and structure that can be adapted for real-world use. Although the current version focuses on the front-end, the architecture allows further extension into backend integration, API connections, and complete workshop automation.
